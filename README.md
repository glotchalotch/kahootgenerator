# kahootgenerator

This (admittedly poorly coded) website (formerly Electron program) generates Kahoot datapacks for Minecraft as seen in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM5fdVFHJ3M).

This site uses [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js) and [JSZip](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip).

It can be accessed by going to https://glotchalotch.github.io/kahootgenerator

If you really want the source code to the Electron app (you don't, there's no reason for you to want it) it's in the `old-app` branch.
